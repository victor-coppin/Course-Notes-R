These are considered the core of the Tidyverse because you’ll use them in almost every analysis: - dplyr : manipulating data frames\n- forcats : provides tools for dealing with categorical variables\n- ggplot2 : producing statistical, or data, graphics\n- lubridate : makes it easier to work with dates and times in R\n- purr : working with functions and iteration in a functional programming style\n#| label: load-tidyverse #| warning = FALSE #| message = FALSE",

    "section": "2.2 Manipulating Data Frames",
    "text": "2.2 Manipulating Data Frames\n\n“The dplyr package from the tidyverse introduces functions that perform some of the most common operations when working with data frames and uses names for these functions that are relatively easy to remember. For instance, to change the data table by adding a new column, we use mutate. To filter the data table to a subset of rows, we use filter. Finally, to subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use select.”\n\n\n2.2.1 The mutate function\nThe mutate function is used to add new columns to a data frame or modify existing ones.\n\n# Add a new column 'rate' to the murders data frame\nmurders  &lt;- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)\n\nNote: to compute the rate, we used total and population columns, which are not defined in the global environment. The mutate function allows us to use the names of the columns directly.\n\n“This is one of dplyr’s main features. Functions in this package, such as mutate, know to look for variables in the data frame provided in the first argument.\nIn the call to mutate above, total will have the values in murders$total. This approach makes the code much more readable and concise.”\n\n\nhead(murders)\n\n       state abb region population total     rate\n1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135 2.824424\n2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19 2.675186\n3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232 3.629527\n4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93 3.189390\n5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257 3.374138\n6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65 1.292453\n\n\nNote: the mutate function does not change the original data frame.\n\n“Although we have overwritten the original murders object, this does not change the object that is loaded with data(murders).\nIf we load the murders data again, the original will overwrite our mutated version.”\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Subsetting with filter\nThe filter function is used to subset rows based on logical conditions.\nFilter the murders data frame to include only the entries for which the murder rate is lower than 0.71.\n\n# Syntax : data, conditional statement.\nfilter(murders, rate &lt;= 0.71)\n\n          state abb        region population total      rate\n1        Hawaii  HI          West    1360301     7 0.5145920\n2          Iowa  IA North Central    3046355    21 0.6893484\n3 New Hampshire  NH     Northeast    1316470     5 0.3798036\n4  North Dakota  ND North Central     672591     4 0.5947151\n5       Vermont  VT     Northeast     625741     2 0.3196211\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Selecting columns with select\nThe select() function is used to extract specific columns from a data frame.\nIn the example below: - We create a new data frame containing only the columns state, region, and rate. - We then apply filter() to keep only the rows where the murder rate is less than or equal to 0.71.\n\nstate_region_rate_table &lt;- select(murders, state, region, rate)\nfilter(state_region_rate_table, rate &lt;= 0.71)\n\n          state        region      rate\n1        Hawaii          West 0.5145920\n2          Iowa North Central 0.6893484\n3 New Hampshire     Northeast 0.3798036\n4  North Dakota North Central 0.5947151\n5       Vermont     Northeast 0.3196211\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Exercises\n\nLoad the dplyr package and the murders dataset.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(dslabs)\ndata(murders)\n\n\nUse the function mutate to add a column rank containing the rank, from highest to lowest murder rate. Make sure you redefine murders so we can keep using this variable.\n\n\nmurders &lt;- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 10^5)\nmurders &lt;- mutate(murders, rank = rank(-rate))\nmurders %&gt;% head()\n\n       state abb region population total     rate rank\n1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135 2.824424   23\n2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19 2.675186   27\n3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232 3.629527   10\n4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93 3.189390   17\n5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257 3.374138   14\n6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65 1.292453   38\n\nselect(murders, state, population) %&gt;% head()\n\n       state population\n1    Alabama    4779736\n2     Alaska     710231\n3    Arizona    6392017\n4   Arkansas    2915918\n5 California   37253956\n6   Colorado    5029196\n\n\nWe can write population rather than murders$population. The function mutate knows we are grabbing columns from murders.\n\nUse select to show the state names and abbreviations in murders. Do not redefine murders, just show the results.\n\n\nselect(murders, state, abb)\n\n                  state abb\n1               Alabama  AL\n2                Alaska  AK\n3               Arizona  AZ\n4              Arkansas  AR\n5            California  CA\n6              Colorado  CO\n7           Connecticut  CT\n8              Delaware  DE\n9  District of Columbia  DC\n10              Florida  FL\n11              Georgia  GA\n12               Hawaii  HI\n13                Idaho  ID\n14             Illinois  IL\n15              Indiana  IN\n16                 Iowa  IA\n17               Kansas  KS\n18             Kentucky  KY\n19            Louisiana  LA\n20                Maine  ME\n21             Maryland  MD\n22        Massachusetts  MA\n23             Michigan  MI\n24            Minnesota  MN\n25          Mississippi  MS\n26             Missouri  MO\n27              Montana  MT\n28             Nebraska  NE\n29               Nevada  NV\n30        New Hampshire  NH\n31           New Jersey  NJ\n32           New Mexico  NM\n33             New York  NY\n34       North Carolina  NC\n35         North Dakota  ND\n36                 Ohio  OH\n37             Oklahoma  OK\n38               Oregon  OR\n39         Pennsylvania  PA\n40         Rhode Island  RI\n41       South Carolina  SC\n42         South Dakota  SD\n43            Tennessee  TN\n44                Texas  TX\n45                 Utah  UT\n46              Vermont  VT\n47             Virginia  VA\n48           Washington  WA\n49        West Virginia  WV\n50            Wisconsin  WI\n51              Wyoming  WY\n\n\n\nUse filter to show the top 5 states with the highest murder rates.\n\n\nfilter(murders,  rank &lt;= 5)\n\n                 state abb        region population total      rate rank\n1 District of Columbia  DC         South     601723    99 16.452753    1\n2            Louisiana  LA         South    4533372   351  7.742581    2\n3             Maryland  MD         South    5773552   293  5.074866    4\n4             Missouri  MO North Central    5988927   321  5.359892    3\n5       South Carolina  SC         South    4625364   207  4.475323    5\n\n\n\nCreate a new data frame called no_south that removes states from the South region. How many states are in this category? You can use the function nrow for this.\n\nNote: We can remove rows using the != operator.

This package is based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), which allows users to compose graphs by combining independent components.\nggplot2 is designed to work iteratively, layer by layer.\n\n4 Grammar of Graphics\nCreated by Wilkinson in 2005, the Grammar of Graphics aims to “describe the fundamental features that underlie all statistical graphics.”\n\n“In brief, the grammar tells us that a graphic maps the data to the aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. The plot may also include statistical transformations of the data and information about the plot’s coordinate system. Facetting can be used to plot for different subsets of the data. The combination of these independent components is what makes up a graphic.” (Wickham, Navarro, & Pedersen, 2023)\n\nResources - The built-in documentation\n- cheatsheets",

    "text": "There are two main approaches to constructing estimators in statistics:\n\nThe Method of Moments\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\n\nThe method of moments is a commonly used and straightforward technique in statistics. It is especially useful when you need to estimate a single parameter associated with a known distribution. The method involves equating sample moments (such as the mean or variance) to their theoretical counterparts and solving for the unknown parameters. Its main advantages are simplicity and broad applicability, making it an accessible introduction to parameter estimation. However, it can be less efficient than other methods and may not always use all the information available in the data.\nMaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a more powerful and general approach. It involves finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, i.e., the values that make the observed data most probable under the assumed model. While MLE often requires solving an optimization problem and can be more computationally intensive, it is widely used in practice due to its desirable statistical properties, such as efficiency and consistency, especially as sample size increases. MLE is particularly important in more complex models, including those with multiple parameters.\nWhen we move to linear models, we will encounter the least squares method, which is closely related to maximum likelihood. In fact, for linear regression with normally distributed errors, the least squares estimator is also the maximum likelihood estimator. This connection highlights the central role of MLE in statistical modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor’s insight\n\n\n\n“The method of moments is the most useful in practice because it is the one that almost everyone knows. Maximum likelihood, while more complex due to its optimization requirements, becomes especially valuable when we deal with models involving several parameters, such as linear models. In those cases, we will see that the least squares method and maximum likelihood are closely related and sometimes even equivalent.”",

    "text": "12.2 Motivation\nLet us consider a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 2:\n\\[\n  X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,2)\n\\]\nSimulating the sample mean of a Gaussian distribution multiple times\nSee the rnorm section\n\nM &lt;- c() # initialize an empty vector to store the means\n\n# Loop over three different sample sizes: 50, 500, and 5,000 \nfor (k in c(50,500,5000)) \n{\n    for (i in 1:50)             # simulate the sample mean 50 times    \n    {\n        A &lt;- rnorm(k,0,sqrt(2)) # generate k observations with mean = 0, variance = 2\n        m &lt;- mean(A)\n        M &lt;- c(M,m)\n    }\n}\n\nWe now create a data frame D with:\n- a column mean containing the 150 sample means (50 for each sample size), and\n- a column label indicating the corresponding sample size.\n\nD &lt;- data.frame(mean = M, label = rep(c('50','500','5000'), each = 50))  # 'rep(..., each = 50)' aligns labels with sample sizes\nboxplot(D$mean ~ D$label,\n        main = \"Distribution of Sample Means by Sample Size\", # Main title of the boxplot\n        xlab = \"Sample Size\", ylab = \"Sample Mean\") #Label for the x-axis and the the y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor’s Insight: Accuracy and Sample Size\n\n\n\nAs we can see in the boxplot:\n- For a sample size of 50, the sample means fluctuate roughly between -0.4 and 0.4. - With 500 observations, the range narrows to around -0.2 to 0.1. - And for 5,000 observations, the fluctuation becomes minimal, between -0.08 and 0.05.\nThis illustrates that as the sample size increases, the accuracy of the sample mean improves, because the fluctuations (i.e., variance) decrease. The quality of the estimation improves at a rate proportional to 1/√n.\n\n\nEffect of variance on estimation accuracy\nWe now study how variance affects the fluctuation of the sample mean, using the same logic as before but fixing the sample size at 500. We consider three different variances: \\[\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)\n\\] \\[\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n\\] \\[\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10)\n\\]\n\nM &lt;- c() \n\n# Loop over three different variances\nfor (k in c(0.1, 1, 10)) {\n  for (i in 1:50) {\n    A &lt;- rnorm(500, 0, sqrt(k))  \n    m &lt;- mean(A)\n    M &lt;- c(M, m)\n  }\n}\n\nD &lt;- data.frame(mean = M, label = rep(c(\"0.1\", \"1\", \"10\"), each = 50))\n\n# Boxplot of the means by variance group\nboxplot(D$mean ~ D$label,\n        main = \"Distribution of Sample Means by Variance\",\n        xlab = \"Variance\", ylab = \"Sample Mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor’s Insight: Sample Size vs Variance\n\n\n\nThese two experiments highlight two distinct effects on the accuracy of the sample mean:\n\nWhen you increase the sample size, you improve the precision of your estimate. The fluctuations around the true mean become smaller, which makes your estimation more reliable.\nIn contrast, when the variance of the distribution increases, the quality of your estimation decreases. The sample mean fluctuates more widely, even with the same number of observations.\n\nSo these two effects move in opposite directions:\n➤ Increasing sample size improves accuracy\n➤ Increasing variance reduces accuracy\n\n\nThese simulations show that the precision of an estimator (like the sample mean) is influenced by two key parameters:\n\nThe sample size \\(n\\): as \\(n\\) increases, the estimation becomes more precise ​\nThe variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) of the underlying distribution: as it increases, the estimate becomes more volatile\n\nSo, the confidence interval, which is used to quantify the uncertainty around an estimate, will depend on both of these factors. Specifically, it depends on a term of the form: \\[\n\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor’s Warning: Plug-in Estimators Are Not Harmless\n\n\n\nWhen replacing an unknown parameter (like variance) with an estimator, you apply what’s called a plug-in method. While this is often necessary, it can alter the distribution of your statistic.\nFor example: - If the true variance \\(\\large\\sigma^2\\;\\) were known (which it never is in practice), then the standardized sample mean would follow a normal distribution. - In reality, since \\(\\large\\sigma^2\\;\\) is unknown, we estimate it with the sample variance.\nWhen we do this, the standardized statistic follows a Student’s t-distribution instead.\n\nThis shift in distribution is not trivial — it must be accounted for in confidence intervals.\n\nPractitioners often ignore this and proceed as if nothing changed. But this is not statistically correct:\nEvery plug-in introduces an approximation step, and chaining them carelessly can make your final inference unreliable.\nTo use plug-in methods correctly, you need supporting results (e.g., convergence in distribution).\nWithout them, the theoretical properties of your inference may no longer hold.\n\nIf you only have data, you never have access to the true parameter — only an estimate. Always be aware of how that impacts your conclusions.",
